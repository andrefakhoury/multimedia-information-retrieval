# Multimedia Information Retrieval

Project made for Multimedia classes at USP São Carlos (2021). Theme: Animal recognition.

The main objective for this project is to develop an information retrieval system, using some concepts seen in Multimedia classes, such as a dictionary of visual words and local feature extraction. Given an image, we should return the most similar images from the dataset.

The dataset we used can be found in: https://www.csc.kth.se/~heydarma/Datasets.html
